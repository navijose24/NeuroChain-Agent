# NeuroChain-Agent
LLM-powered parallel, sequential, and loop agents that automate entire business workflows end-to-end.

Build a multi-agent system called 'NeuroChain Agents' in Google Colab, following the detailed plan that includes initial setup, implementing core utilities, memory, tools (Google Search, Python Execution sandbox, File I/O), agents (Research, Search, Code-Runner), an Orchestrator agent, observability and evaluation hooks, context engineering, demo workflows, a Gradio UI, and project documentation.
